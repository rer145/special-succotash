Flexdashboard examples for DATA 650 at Mercyhurst University

## Introduction
This is an example repository demonstrating the flexdashboard package for creating simple dashboards.

## Files
The file babe-ruth.R contains the scripts used to gather and visualize data, and babe-ruth.Rmd is the flexdashboard template to display those visualizations.  babe-ruth.html is the generated output file.

The file golftrack.R contains scripts to generate charts from a custom dataset I built, where I collected golf data from every round of golf I've played over the last few years. This data is stored in a Microsoft SQL Server database on a remote server.  The database connection credentials have been removed from the code.
